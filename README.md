# Ajax

This is the repo for [Udacity's Ajax course](). The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

####To Send An Async Request
* create an XHR object with the XMLHttpRequest constructor function
* use the .open() method - set the HTTP method and the URL of the resource to be fetched
* set the .onload property - set this to a function that will run upon a successful fetch
* set the .onerror property - set this to a function that will run when an error occurs
* use the .send() method - send the request

####To Use The Response
* use the .responseText property - holds the text of the async request's response
