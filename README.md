# Ajax

In this exercise I work on making asynchronous requests using three different methods.

### 1. Ajax with XHR

#### To Send An Async Request
* create an XHR object with the XMLHttpRequest constructor function
* use the .open() method - set the HTTP method and the URL of the resource to be fetched
* set the .onload property - set this to a function that will run upon a successful fetch
* set the .onerror property - set this to a function that will run when an error occurs
* use the .send() method - send the request

#### To Use The Response
* use the .responseText property - holds the text of the async request's response

### 2. Ajax with jQuery

### 3. Ajax with Fetch
